I have been meaning to get a desk plant for a long time and I have always liked the
aesthetics of bonsai trees being sculpted into living artworks.

I have also been wanting to generate a dataset that I care about and have some sort
of investment in to nurture my hobby interest of data science and data visualisation.

So one day whilst I was installing tap timers and a drip irrigation system for my
garden to optimize for the least effort to maintain I realised that with the 
proliferation of hobby microcontrollers I could fuse those hobbies and have
the most overengineered desk plant.

I chose the Arduino MKR 1000 since it came in a beginners bundle, it is a very
small form factor compared to the UNO or the Raspberry Pi and it came with a WiFi
shield builtin.

I picked the Juniperus variety since they are evergreen and are the the most iconic 
foliage coming from the coniferus family.

I have named it Troy after Troy Landry from Swamp People since his catch phrase
["Treeshaker! Treeshaker!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCRbDQefxIg) got stuck
in my head.
